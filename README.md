# Diabetes-Prediction-Identifying-Patients-at-Risk
This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can help identify individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes.

Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset consisting of various features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, among others. The dataset has been preprocessed and is included in the data directory.

Model Development
The main Python script for building and evaluating the prediction model can be found in the diabetes.ipynb notebook. It utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow to preprocess the data, train the model, and assess its performance.

Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to the creators of the original dataset used in this project. Their efforts in data collection and curation have been invaluable.

Happy Predicting !
